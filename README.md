#The Node Authenticator
This app is a practice exercise for me to learn how to authenticate a user in Node without the help of OAuth or Passport.  This app uses a database, salted and hashed passwords, and a JWT token.  If you opt to use this app, you will be able to sign up, log in, see your 'profile', and log out.

Part of this app was done by following "The Complete Node Developer" course on Udemy, but the instructor did not show how to implement the front-end with the back-end, so I opted to use Angular for my front-end so I could learn how to implement authenticated routes.
